<h1 align="center">SlimeVR Nightshade Case</h1>

> A custom case designed to fit Lupinixx's Hyperion BMI160 PCB.

## Components

- TP4056
- Wemos D1 Mini
- BMI160
- 1in Straps
- SS12D00G3 (switch)
- 804040 Battery
- 1N5817 Diode (2x)
- 180K Ohm resistor

The components are identical to the ones used in Lupinixx's [Hyperion BMI160 PCB](https://github.com/Lupinixx/SlimeVR-Hyperion-BMI160-PCB) as the case is designed for their PCB. (Except there is only one battery size for this design)

## Contributing and Discussions

Contributions are always welcome! If you want to contribute, feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/ImCarsen/SlimeVR-Hyperion-Mod/issues). If there are any errors with the models, please let me know (if you have the capabilities, and would want to fix or improve anything, you're more than welcome to; I will keep updated on pull requests).

## Acknowledgements and References

I am using this myself, if something doesn't work, I will fix it until I am happy with it. I will make AUX cases to go along with this soon.

This is based on these projects:
- [Hyperion](https://github.com/Smeltie/Hyperion)
- [SlimeVR-Hyperion-BMI160-PCB](https://github.com/Lupinixx/SlimeVR-Hyperion-BMI160-PCB)

This case exists for the following reasons:
- No AUX case made for the BMI160 PCB and the original didn't fit it well (also didn't accomodate 4pin JST). 
- Fillets on the sides of the Hyperion case were a massive pain to get looking good when printing.
- I wanted 1in straps
- I felt like learning CAD

All of that added up, so thought I might as well just design my own case from the ground up.

If you're curious on why I named this "Nightshade":
- I like peppers and I like this song
